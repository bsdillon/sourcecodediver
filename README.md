# SourceCodeDiver
![SourceCodeDiver Logo](scd_logo_thumb.png)

**SourceCodeDiver** is a code review and visualization tool designed to help developers explore software architecture without a human in the loop. It generates layered UML diagrams from real-world source code and presents them in an interactive, explorable interfaceâ€”what we call *Pan & Tilt* navigation. The goal: make large systems understandable at a glance, and in depth.
