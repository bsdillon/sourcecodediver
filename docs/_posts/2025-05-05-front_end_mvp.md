Returning to this as a newly unemployed person. Time to refocus my energy on this project.
* Create a new branch for front end. Reruning my container.
  - Build threw some error becasue I was actively writing here. Odd....
  - Rebuild is taking forever. Probably an internet issue.
* Not to create ANOTHER side task, but I've been thinking that I need a faster computer anyway and I have a new laptop I can configure.
