This may seem like a side quest, but a major part of my skills are dedicated to education, training, and mentoring. So I am going to take what I have learned about React and turn it into educational content. Now, that is also helpful in making sure **I** have the subject clearly in my own head and I often find that in six months the person I am training... is me. Here, I can really let Chip loose so he can do what he does best.
* I asked Chip to create a basic HTML page as a start.
* I gave Chip a hello world example in index.js and asked it to generate a table with columns for description and this code. I went through some style and content changes, then gave it back to chip to review. The next section of code and content came out formatted exactly as I wanted. By the third time he had found two small bugs in my changes. He also started generating examples showing the point I wanted to make.
* For version 2.0, I asked Chip why he chose to include a new Container component in the index.js and he agreed that the best practice would separate them. For clarity I asked him to re-draft it.
* I had to ask Chip several questions about this example because it finally got to the heart of HOW React does what it does. Once I asked the right question, he gave me the scoop on the Virtual DOM and it became clearer.
* At this point, however, Chip had lost the thread and I needed to update the HTML myself.
* I asked Chip to make a list of other major language features I needed to learn.
* Only at the end did I realize that I never created a feature branch for this. Poo. I'll have to get used it to it.
