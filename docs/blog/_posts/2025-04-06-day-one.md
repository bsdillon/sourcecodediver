## From Chip
I’m currently looking for a new position, and while I’ve worked extensively in software engineering, the tools and technologies I used were mostly dictated by the needs of my previous role. As a result, there are a number of modern frameworks and platforms I haven’t yet had the opportunity to work with directly. To address this gap, I’ve launched a focused project to build up hands-on experience in current industry tech and practices. The repository is public and can be found [here](https://github.com/bsdillon/sourcecodediver).

This project centers on taking the core analysis engine I developed during my PhD work and turning it into a full-featured web application. The frontend will be interactive and responsive, using a modern framework, while the backend will be containerized and integrated with visualization tools. Now that I am working without the constraints of my previous role, the goal is to demonstrate both technical capability and the ability to quickly adopt and apply new technologies in a meaningful, real-world context.

## From Me
Thanks to the wonderful new technology in chatgpt, I am accelerating my work above what I can do normally by hand. Not that I'm unproductive on my own, but it helps to have a ready reference that I can work with to get answers to questions, generate baseline code or text, and quickly build up something I can **edit** rather than generate from the ground up. No, he's not always reliable, but it's amazing how quickly things are built with his help. Like a very excited lab-puppy with amazing recall, but not much experience in real-world applications. Here we go.

Task one was setting up the project, the basic schedule, and objectives in the kanban board. Also a web presence with github pages and this blog. That's not really programming, but I figured doing the whole thing right started with declaring and organizing rather than pure tech stack. After that I tackled the first real objective which was a simple react page in a container. Working that now. It's something like my flask experience, but I'm concerned that Chip is giving me incomplete information. I'm going to need to verify everything he's saying and so far I have a lot of questions....
